            I was studying film when I stumbled with his work. Of course that by studying film, I was going to know it in one way or another. But the way that I got to see his astonish directing and writing job, it was pure luck. The story goes like this. I had to do an analysis of a director who was going to be chosen at random. In order to do so, I had to watch at least two films by this said director. 
            <br><br>
            Yes, you guessed, I had to do it about him. After the draw, I told the situation to an old friend of mine who happened to know the work of this unknown director... Don't blame me, I was expecting to do the analysis about Scorsese. So, my friend gifted me the movies "Magnolia" and "Punch Drunk Love". I watched them in one day.

                <h1>Paul Thomas Anderson</h1>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
            After that, I kept not only thinking about the technical parts of them, but also about what they made me feel. No movie, until that day touched me so deep as Magnolia did. Without exaggeration, it blowed my mind. I just hadn't realized that I had spent more than three hours in front of the tv. Since the beginning, the story walks you throught the stories of ten different characters, without letting you take a breath.
            <br><br>
            Every scene, every shot and even every dialogue seems to have been meticulously thought out, there is absoluteley no waste in this film. Little by little, the characters start to take off their masks, dusting off all of their miseries, their hopes, their fears, expectations; up to the point where there is nothing else left of them, other than what they really are: vulnerable human beings. Thank you P. T Anderson! In my opinion, there is no much directors out there with such an ingenius and delicate eye.

            <q>I think my job is to try and be as honest as I can with what is in my mind and how I feel - I think that's what you're supposed to do, if you're a good writer. So I try to do that. I know I do that. I do do that.</q>
